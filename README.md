- [XO by Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)

XO is a wrapper around ESLint, which makes the console output prettier and defines a set of default linting rules. It's used in combination with [sindresorhus/sublimelinter-contrib-xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/sublimelinter-contrib-xo), which integrates XO into Sublime Text.
